# Quickstart with Relay Modern

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/): Frontend framework for building user interfaces
* [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/): Powerful GraphQL client developed by Facebook
* [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool): Backend development framework based on GraphQL + Serverless

## Quickstart

<!--
For more information on how to get started [refer to the full react-relay-instagram tutorial](https://www.graph.cool/docs/quickstart/react-relay-instagram/).
--> 

### 1. Clone example repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-graphql.git
cd react-graphql/quickstart-with-relay-modern
```

### 2. Create Graphcool service with the [Graphcool CLI](https://docs-next.graph.cool/reference/graphcool-cli/overview-zboghez5go)

```sh
# Install Graphcool Framework CLI
npm install -g graphcool

# Create a new service inside a directory called `server`
graphcool init server
```

This created the following file structure in the current directory:

```
.
└── server
    ├── graphcool.yml
    ├── types.graphql
    └── src
        ├── hello.graphql
        └── hello.js
```

### 3. Define data model

Next, you need to define your data model inside the newly created `types.graphql`-file.

Replace the current contents in `types.graphql` with the following type definition (you can delete the predefined `User` type):

```graphql
type Post @model {
  # Required system field
  id: ID! @isUnique # read-only (managed by Graphcool)

  # Optional system fields (remove if not needed)
  createdAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)
  updatedAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)

  description: String!
  imageUrl: String!
}
```

### 4. Deploy the GraphQL server

You're now ready to put your Graphcool service into production! Navigate into the `server` directory and [deploy](https://docs-next.graph.cool/reference/graphcool-cli/commands-aiteerae6l#graphcool-deploy) the service:

```sh
cd server
graphcool deploy
```

When prompted which cluster you want to deploy to, choose any of the **Shared Clusters** options (`shared-eu-west-1`, `shared-ap-northeast-1` or `shared-us-west-2`).

Save the HTTP endpoint for the `Relay API` from the output, you'll need it in the next step.

> **Note**: You can now test your GraphQL API inside a GraphQL playground. Simply type the `graphcool playground` command and start sending queries and mutations. Note that the Playground by default is running against the `Simple API` but can easily be adjusted to use the `Relay API`.


### 5. Connect the app with your GraphQL API

Paste the `Relay API` endpoint to `./src/createRelayEnvironment.js` as the argument for the call to `fetch` replacing `__RELAY_API_ENDPOINT__ `:

```js
// replace `__RELAY_API_ENDPOINT__ ` with the endpoint from the previous step
return fetch('__RELAY_API_ENDPOINT__', {
 ...
})  
```

> **Note**: If you ever lose your endpoint, you can get access to it again with the `graphcool info` command.6
### 6. Install dependencies & run locally

```sh
cd ..
yarn install
yarn relay # invoke relay compiler
yarn start # open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```
